Welcome to this repository,
This repository is my and my group's work on our Software Group Project on theme of nostalgic games that were played since our childhood. So we named it as "THE MILLENNIALS" as reference to that nostalgic experience.
This website includes a good combination of user interactive functions, childhood games, mind refreshing and eye pleasing colour combinations,  and a bunch of gifs and sound combinations according to games.
Our main intention is to provide user the joy through this games and update the website frequently and improve it as per user's suggestion to make user feel that this is actually their own website and they freely allow their suggestions to make this website more creative and interactive than before.
So come and join us in this journey of making everyone happy and joyful by playing their childhood games on this digital platform at anytime anywhere.
